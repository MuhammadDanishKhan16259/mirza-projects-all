# Modern Application and API Development

This program of [Saylani Welfare Trust](https://www.saylaniwelfare.com/) will teach you to build Modern Full-Stack Serverless Mobile Web Cloud SaaS Apps and APIs. This program focuses on React based front-ends and microservices based, API-first, cloud SaaS and headless backend technologies. Most of frontend teaching material covered in the program is advocated by [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and backend technologies by [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/). [SJGAR stack](https://www.sjgarstack.org/blog/20201028/introducing-the-sjgar-stack) also proposes the stack we are using.

Overview of the concepts by a Student:

[Project Submit Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAj_NogliczLma_YvlE9r1FbBhamiq6dhJy77SIpbxZPYmvw/viewform)


Review the [code and demo](https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNGGaV) and improve and build your own Red Queens Race Animation with React Hooks.

Note the following:

1. When Alice drinks from the bottle, she grows smaller. 
2. Because small children tire out easily, unlike automaton chess pieces, Alice is constantly slowing down.
3. But urging them on by clicking or tapping causes them to speed up.
4. The background elements also have playback rates that are impacted when you click or tap.

"Our eyes are hardwired to notice movement. Historically, it’s helped to keep us alive. And, in 2020, web designers are capitalizing on this default human setting.
Animated illustrations are one of the newest trends being used to direct viewer attention within web designs.  You’ll see these petite animations on sites all over the web.
Some animated illustrations are merely still graphics that jiggle, while other illustrated animations are more thoughtful and complex. When used to their fullest capacity, animated illustrations can tell stories, explain concepts, or help viewers navigate a website."

[20 Extraordinary Web Design Ideas That Will Get Everyone Clicking](https://www.jeffbullas.com/web-design-ideas/)
Incorporating illustration on a website has been a trend for a few years. However, designers are now focusing to create custom and 3D illustrations to define a brand.
An illustration can empower a brand if blended well with minimalism. See how the brand Neat has rightly executed this trend:

[Neat Website](https://thisisneat.com.au/)

To intrigue viewers, brands like Pitch have introduced 3D illustration design:

In this project you will build a animated React Website, all animations must use the latest Web Animations API and latest trends.

Mirage Notes:

1. Mirage runs in the browser, so there's no new terminal processes to manage
2. Returning data from Mirage is as fast and easy as writing frontend code
3. You never alter your application code to consume data from Mirage – your app thinks it's talking to a real network

### Project 9B: Building Diaries App using React and Redux Toolkit with TypeScript
In this project we will be learning to use Redux by building an app that lets users create and manage diaries. We will be building our application using React, and we’ll set up Mirage as our API mocking server since we have not yet learned to build API's.

[We will follow this Tutorial: Setting Up Redux For Use In A Real-World Application](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/redux-real-world-application/)

[Partial implementation, of only login and signup with react, redux and mirage by Zeeshan](https://github.com/zeeshanhanif/diaries-app-partial)

Note: In the project React Router v5 is being used we recommend that you use v6 in your project.

This Project is very important because up to now we have been doing small projects which focused on only focused limited functionality. Project 9B is the first real-world professional project. In the real-world, we will be doing these kinds of projects. Therefore, give special attention to it.

We want GitHub Actions workflow that builds a static blog site and deploys on Surge. Our content is hosted on Contentful. We would like to rebuild my static site on a normal repository push event, and also via the Contentful webhook whenever our content is updated. [Reference 1](https://github.community/t/is-it-possible-to-trigger-a-single-workflow-in-github-actions-from-two-different-events/16120) [Reference 2](https://medium.com/@flawyte/zeit-now-github-action-contentful-webhook-6a697d2053cd)

Important Challenge Requirement:
We want you to build this blog site with gated content, available only for logged-in users. However we still want the blogs to be indexed for SEO reasons, and would like visitors (not logged in) have access to 3 free blogs (just like Medium), after that we want to user to get a "limited" access to each page (maybe 20 lines or so), just like news website sometimes do. The logged-in users will have unlimited access to all the blogs. We will use [Firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for user logins.

## Module III: API Economy and Cloud Development

Get AWS Account

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

[AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

For AWS Educate Account you will need a email address issued by an educational institute or university.

Now you can create virtual VISA Debit card through [NayaPay App](https://www.nayapay.com/) which can be used to create AWS/GCP/Azure account. This is good NEWS For those students who find it difficult to create physical VISA/Master Card from Banks; this is a great option to avail.

Before we get started please Review the concepts proposed by [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/).


### Video 1: Understanding the API Economy

[Report: 67% of developers embrace an API-first philosophy](https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/28/report-67-of-developers-embrace-an-api-first-philosophy/)


The objective of this module is to prepare sofware developers for the API Economy (Application Programming Interface Economy). APIs are software interfaces that allow once separate software systems to seamlessly and easily talk to each other.  The innovative power of APIs has lead to the realization that software as a service (SaaS) applications can be built by combining APIs built by specialized API providers. That, in turn, has created the API Economy, which empowers developers to specialize and monetize their skills and domain knowledge.

A taxi booking SaaS app, for example, might combine a mapping SaaS API, communication SaaS API, and billing SaaS API, each from different providers, with their own UX layered on top. This makes it easy to launch new services without having to build everything from scratch. This makes it easier for all participants to develop unique products, services and functionality quickly and with less cost. 

In the API economy a developer may have different roles. It may be a SaaS developer or API provider. A API provider can also develop on top of other specialized APIs, thus creating layers of APIs. This creates an API economy where developers charge each other for the APIs built by them. The API provider charges others for using his APIs, and at the same time pays other providers to use their APIs. The SaaS app developers who uses all these APIs bills the end-customer for the service. This exchange of value is what makes an API economy.    

Ideally, the developer who uses SaaS APIs wants to be charged a usage based subscription fee, not a fixed monthly subscription. This usage based subscription fee has been made possible by serverless cloud technologies. Serverless is also being called Cloud 2.0.

The rise of of API Economy has created a new kind of software company i.e. an API-First Company. A company, which develops software not for the end-users as its main customer, but other developers who uses it as a component to build applications. The Panacloud platform provides the means by which developers and entrepreneurs can build their API-First Unicorn startups. 

The API Economy levels the playing field for everyone from the smallest developers to the largest companies. However, it also creates many challenges. First, often there is no direct contact between the API provider and the developer who utilizes it, it can be hard to know which API to build with what functionality. Second, it is difficult to know which APIs are available and which API to use and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. Third, most of the current SaaS applications and API are built using legacy Cloud 1.0 technologies, thus they don’t have usage based billing support and also some have scalability issues. Fourth, the APIs are centrally managed and multi-tenant by their very nature, making it difficult to manage, measure resource usage in a serverless environment, and bill the tenant. Fifth, each and every API provider has to build a custom platform to monitor and measure serverless resource usage and bill clearing functionality thus increasing the time-to-market. Sixth, there is an extreme shortage of serverless cloud developers thus making life every difficult for both API providers and SaaS app companies. Seventh, there is a scarcity of coherent and comprehensive training material for multi-tenant severless SaaS app and API developers.

Panacloud has started and is leading a social movement called Operation Unicorn to help anyone and everyone become a cloud developer, a startup founder, and participant in the API economy. The focus is on building API-First startups, which will in time become billion dollar companies. This movement is striving to build a community that will not only transform individuals, but societies and countries as well.

Reading Material:

[CockroachDB Serverless Launches, Aspires to Be Developers’ Database](https://thenewstack.io/cockroachdb-serverless-launches-aspires-to-be-developers-database/)

A new class of Serverless PostgreSQL Databases are emerging we plan to focus on them:

1. [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/)
2. [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/postgresql/hyperscale/)
3. [CockroachDB Serverless](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-we-built-cockroachdb-serverless/)

CockroachDB Serverless runs on all three major cloud platforms, without requiring an account on any one of them and also has a free tier. This versatility is attractive to developers and for teaching students. Therefore, we will use it for teaching.
